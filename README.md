# DocAI
Document QnA with AI

# The Project Overview:

Document AI is a powerful tool developed, offering state-of-the-art techniques for document processing, including entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and natural language understanding. Mistral-7B LLM, specializes in understanding and generating text, making it ideal for tasks requiring nuanced language comprehension.

# How It Works:
1. Document Upload: Users can drag and drop their PDF documents through the application interface.

2. Query Processing: Upon receiving a query from the user, the application utilizes the Mistral-7B LLM model to understand the intent and extract relevant information from the uploaded documents.

3. Response Generation: Based on the query and the content of the documents, the system generates a concise and informative response, addressing the user's query.
